# About
Here is the configuration to Awesome window manager. Awesome WM's documentation is confusing if you do not know what you are looking for. I craeted this configuration to help get you familiar to Awesome WM and the Lua programming language. I listed the programs I use so all the shortcuts to that program work out of the box.
